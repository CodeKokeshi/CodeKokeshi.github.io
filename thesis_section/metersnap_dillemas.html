            <!-- 1.0 Justification for Carmona Water District (CWD) -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-b pb-2 mb-4">1.0 Why We Chose Carmona Water District (CWD) as our Case Study</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">A core decision in our research was choosing the Carmona Water District (CWD) as our single area of focus. This was not a random choice, but a deliberate, strategic decision to ensure our project is feasible, financially responsible, and academically strong. We based this on three comprehensive arguments:</p>

                <ul class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 space-y-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Logistical & Financial Feasibility (The "Hub" Argument):</strong>
                        <p class="ml-4 text-gray-700">As a small research group of students, we had to be realistic about our budget and time. Our project's central meeting place and "hub" is the **CvSU Carmona campus**. With members living in nearby areas (Timbao, Langkiwa, GMA, and Carmona), the campus is our main coordination point. This geographic reality makes CWD the *only* logistically sound choice. Trying to cover multiple water districts (like Maynilad or Manila Water) would require an enormous, unrealistic travel budget and a level of logistical coordination that is not feasible for our team.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A Bounded and Verifiable "Case Study" (The "Blueprint" Argument):</strong>
                        <p class="ml-4 text-gray-700">Making an "all-in-one" bill calculator is impossible, as every water district has its own complex billing rules. CWD provides a perfect, bounded "case study" because its data is public and verifiable. We can access their official **billing structures** (rate tiers for Residential, Commercial, etc.), which are stable and easy to check. This allows us to prove our app's math is correct. Our goal isn't to make a universal app, but to create a successful *blueprint* that proves the `(Local Billing Logic + Local AI Training)` concept works and can be replicated by others.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>AI Data Collection Requirements (The "Meter Farm" Argument):</strong>
                        <p class="ml-4 text-gray-700">This is our most critical technical reason. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) needs to be trained on *thousands* of images. Our logistical proximity (Point 1) is essential for this primary data collection. It allows us to visit the dense customer base of CWD repeatedly, capturing the high volume of images we need in all real-world conditions: in bright sunlight, in deep shadow, at night, in the rain, covered in dirt, new, old, and scratched. Focusing only on CWD makes gathering this high-variance dataset *possible*.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-6 p-4 bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-blue-600">
                    <strong>Our Position:</strong> Our choice of CWD wasn't for convenience; it was a necessary, multi-faceted strategic decision. It is the only way we can feasibly manage the project's **logistics and budget**, using the CvSU campus as our hub. It provides the **stable, public billing rules** that allow us to prove our concept within a **bounded case study**, as advised by our Research Coordinator. And most importantly, it gives us the dense, accessible **"meter farm"** required to gather the thousands of real-world images needed to successfully train our AI.

            <!-- 2.0 Clarifying the "Client-Based" Dilemma -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-b pb-2 mb-4">2.0 Who Is Our "Client"? (Clearing up the Confusion)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">We needed to clear up some confusion about the term "client-based." Our project focuses on the *customers* of CWD, not the CWD organization itself. This difference is important for how we gather data and what our project's goals are. To make this clear, we've defined who is who:</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">2.1 The End-User (Our Primary Focus)</h3>
                <p>The "client"—or more accurately, our **end-user**—is the individual CWD customer. Our project is built for consumers. The main problem we are trying to solve is the customer's problem: feeling uncertain about their bill or getting "bill shock" at the end of the month. Because of this, our app's success is measured by how well it meets the needs of these customers.</p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-2">2.2 The Domain Provider (CWD's Role)</h3>
                <p>The Carmona Water District (CWD) isn't our "client" in the way most people think of it. They didn't hire us to make this app. Instead, CWD is our **Domain Provider**. This means they are the source of the "business rules"—the specific billing rates and customer types that our app needs to know to be accurate. Our app is *tailored* to CWD's rules, but it isn't *built for* the CWD organization.</p>

                <p class="mt-6 p-4 bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-green-600">
                    <strong>Our Position:</strong> This difference is very important. It means our main focus is on the *end-user's* needs (making the app clear and easy to use). At the same time, our main limitation is the *domain's* rules (we must follow CWD's rates). This clears up the confusion: we are building a tool that helps users, but it must operate inside a specific, unchangeable set of rules.

            <!-- 3.0 Data Collection Strategy & Risk Management -->
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 border-b pb-2 mb-4">3.0 Our Data Collection Strategy (And Why We Don't Need CWD's Permission)</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">This brings us to our data collection plan. What happens if CWD isn't cooperative? What if they don't want to share internal data, like logs of customer complaints?</p>
                
                <p class="mb-4">Our research plan is designed to work even if this happens. We've identified two different types of data that we need:</p>

                <ul class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 space-y-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>System Data (The "How-to"):</strong> This is the billing math. As we said earlier, this is public information. We don't need CWD's permission or help to get it. We can find it in public records or just by looking at any customer's paper bill.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Problem Data (The "Why"):</strong> This is the proof that a problem *actually exists* (for example, finding out if customers are really confused or unhappy about their bills). We don't need CWD's internal complaint logs to prove this. In fact, our research is *stronger* if we gather this information ourselves, as primary data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mt-6 p-4 bg-gray-50 border-l-4 border-red-600">
                    <strong>Our Strategy:</strong> Our strategy is simple: we will go straight to the source. We will conduct our own surveys and interviews *directly with the end-users* (the CWD customers) to prove that this problem is real. This approach is better for our research than just using second-hand reports from CWD. It also means our project doesn't depend on CWD's cooperation and keeps our focus where it belongs: on the customer's experience.
