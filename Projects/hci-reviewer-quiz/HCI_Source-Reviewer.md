*Synthesized from Lessons 1-2*

## **1\. Introduction to Interaction Design (Lesson 1\)**

### **1.1 What is Interaction Design?**

**Interaction Design** is defined as ***"Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives."***

It is an overarching term for many fields (UI design, UX design, etc.) and asks the key question: ***"How do you optimize the users' interactions with a system... so that they support the users' activities in effective, useful, usable and pleasurable ways?"***

### **1.2 Components of Interaction Design**

Interaction Design is fundamentally interdisciplinary, drawing from and overlapping with many fields.

* **Academic Disciplines (Inputs):** Ergonomics, Psychology/Cognitive Science, Design, Informatics, Engineering, Computer Science/Software Engineering, and Social Sciences.  
* **Design Practices (Inputs):** Graphic Design, Product Design, Artist-Design, Industrial Design, and the Film Industry.  
* **Interdisciplinary Fields (Overlaps):** Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human Factors (HF), Cognitive Engineering, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), Information Systems, and Ubiquitous Computing.

### **1.3 Who is Involved?**

Interaction design is ideally carried out by **Multidisciplinary Teams**.

* **Concept:** The ***skill sets of engineers, designers, programmers, psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, artists,*** etc., are drawn upon.  
* **Benefit:** This diversity leads to ***more ideas being generated*** and more creative, original designs.  
* **Downside:** It can be costly and lead to ***communication difficulties***, as people from different backgrounds have different perspectives and terminology.

### **1.4 The User Experience (UX)**

**The User Experience (UX)** is defined by **Jakob Nielsen and Don Norman (2014)** as ***encompassing "all aspects of the end user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products."***

**Jesse Garrett** notes that ***"Every product that is used by someone has a user experience: newspapers, ketchup bottles, reclining armchairs, cardigan sweaters."*** It is about ***how people feel about a product***, including their pleasure and satisfaction.

* **Core Principle (of UX):** ***One cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience.*** We design the features (e.g., a smooth case) that evoke a satisfying or sensual experience.  
* **Goal (of UX):** As **Don Norman (2004)** states, ***"It is not enough that we build products that function... we also need to build joy and excitement, pleasure and fun, and yes, beauty to people's lives."***

## **2\. Understanding Users (Lesson 2\)**

### **2.1 Accessibility and Inclusiveness**

**Accessibility** refers to ***the extent to which an interactive product is accessible by as many people as possible.*** The focus is often on people with disabilities (e.g., Apple's VoiceOver).

**Inclusiveness** means ***"being fair, open, and equal to everyone."*** It is an overarching approach to accommodate the widest possible number of people.

**Disability (in HCI)** is ***viewed as the result of poor interaction design*** between a user and the technology, not the impairment alone.

**Types of Impairment:**

* **Sensory:** Loss of vision or hearing.  
* **Physical:** Loss of function in parts of the body.  
* **Cognitive:** Learning impairment or loss of memory.

**Categories of Impairment:**

* **Permanent:** Long-term (e.g., wheelchair user).  
* **Temporary:** After an accident or illness.  
* **Situational:** A noisy environment causing temporary hearing loss.

### **2.2 Usability Goals**

**Usability** refers to ***ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective.*** It is broken down into six goals:

1. **Effectiveness:** ***How good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do.***  
2. **Efficiency:** ***The way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks.*** (e.g., **Amazon.com's** patented ***one-click option***).  
3. **Safety:** ***Protecting the user from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations.*** This includes ***preventing serious errors*** (e.g., not placing "Quit" next to "Save") and ***providing recovery options (e.g., an 'undo' function)***.  
4. **Utility:** ***The extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality*** so users can do what they need or want to do.  
5. **Learnability:** ***How easy a system is to learn to use.*** People want to get started quickly without much effort.  
6. **Memorability:** ***How easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned.*** This is crucial for products used infrequently.

### **2.3 User Experience (UX) Goals**

**UX Goals** are ***concerned with the subjective qualities of how a system feels to a user***, rather than objective criteria like efficiency.

* **Desirable Aspects:** Satisfying, fun, enjoyable, engaging, challenging, rewarding, supporting creativity, etc.  
* **Undesirable Aspects:** Boring, frustrating, unpleasant, annoying, making one feel stupid, etc.

### **2.4 Design Principles**

**Design Principles** are ***generalizable abstractions intended to orient designers*** toward thinking about different aspects of their designs.

1. **Visibility:** ***The more visible functions are, the more likely it is that users will be able to know what to do next.*** As **Don Norman (1988)** describes, the controls of a car are clearly visible. When functions are hidden, they are harder to find and use.  
2. **Feedback:** ***Sending back information about what action has been done and what has been accomplished,*** allowing the person to continue with the activity.  
3. **Constraint:** ***Determining ways of restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place at a given moment.*** This ***prevents the user from making errors*** (e.g., graying out unavailable menu options).  
4. **Consistency:** ***Designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for achieving similar tasks.*** A consistent interface is easier to learn and use.  
5. **Affordance:** ***An attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it.*** At a simple level, it means ***"to give a clue."*** For example, a door handle affords pulling, and a graphical button affords pushing (clicking).
