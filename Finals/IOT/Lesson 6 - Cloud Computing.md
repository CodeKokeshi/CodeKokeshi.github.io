# **Cloud Computing**

**Lesson 6**

## **The Problem Cloud Computing Solves: The "Old Way" vs. The "New Way"**

* ***The "Old Way" (On-Premises)***: The company had to buy powerful ***physical servers***, ***storage disks***, and ***networking equipment***. This required a huge ***upfront investment***, known as ***Capital Expenditure (CapEx)***. They had to ***guess their peak traffic needs***, often buying far more capacity than they used day-to-day, leading to ***wasted resources***. If they needed a new server, the process of ordering, installing, and configuring it could take ***weeks or even months***.  
* ***The "New Way" (Cloud Computing)***: The cloud changes this model entirely. Instead of buying hardware, you ***rent computing power*** from a ***cloud provider*** (like ***AWS, Google, or Microsoft***). This shifts the cost from a large upfront investment to a manageable ***monthly bill***, known as an ***Operational Expenditure (OpEx)***. This model ***eliminates guesswork***, ***long waiting times***, and ***wasted resources***.

## **What is Cloud Computing?**

***Cloud Computing*** is a technology that allows you to ***store and access data and applications over the internet*** instead of using your computer's ***hard drive*** or a ***local server***.

### **On-Demand Services**

Cloud computing delivers essential computing services—including ***servers, storage, databases, networking, and software***—all over the Internet. It's about ***accessing resources as you need them***, rather than owning and maintaining them.

### **Shared & Scalable**

This model enables ***on-demand access*** to a pool of ***shared, scalable resources***. Organizations can ***rapidly provision and de-provision*** computing power, ensuring they always have the right amount of capacity without the ***upfront investment in physical infrastructure***.

"You don't generate your own electricity. Why generate your own computing?" — Jeff Bezos, Founder of Amazon.

## **Cloud Deployment Models**

1. ***Public Cloud***: Services are offered by ***third-party providers*** over the ***public internet***, open to anyone who wants to use them. Examples include ***Amazon Web Services (AWS)*** and ***Google Cloud Platform***.  
2. ***Private Cloud***: Dedicated to a ***single organization***, a private cloud can be hosted ***on-premises*** or by a ***third-party***, offering ***enhanced security and control*** tailored to specific business needs.  
3. ***Hybrid Cloud***: A mix of ***public and private clouds***, this model allows ***data and applications to move*** between the two environments, providing greater ***flexibility*** and ***optimized resource allocation***.

Nearly ***90% of companies*** now leverage ***multicloud strategies***. This approach ***enhances resilience***, ***prevents vendor lock-in***, and ***optimizes performance***.

## **Cloud Service Models Explained**

1. ***IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)***: Provides fundamental computing resources like ***virtual machines, storage, and networking*** over the internet. You manage your ***operating systems, applications, and data***, while the provider handles the ***underlying infrastructure***. Example: ***Amazon EC2***.  
2. ***PaaS (Platform as a Service)***: Delivers a ***platform*** allowing developers to ***build, run, and manage applications*** without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure. Example: ***Google App Engine***.  
3. ***SaaS (Software as a Service)***: Provides ***ready-to-use software applications*** over the internet on a ***subscription basis***. Users access the software via a ***web browser or mobile app***. Examples: ***Microsoft 365*** and ***Salesforce***.

## **Why Businesses Choose Cloud Computing**

* ***Cost Efficiency***: Reduces operational costs by eliminating expensive ***hardware investments*** and maintenance. Businesses ***pay only for resources consumed***.  
* ***Scalability & Flexibility***: Enables ***instant scaling*** of resources to meet fluctuating demand spikes without ***over-provisioning***.  
* ***Global Accessibility***: Data and applications are accessible ***anytime, anywhere***, from any device with an internet connection.  
* ***Business Continuity***: Offers robust ***automated backup solutions***, ***disaster recovery***, and ***high availability***.

## **Real-World Cloud Computing**

* ***Gmail and Outlook***: Leverage cloud infrastructure to ***store and synchronize*** communications across devices.  
* ***Netflix***: Streams high-definition video content worldwide, relying on cloud servers to handle ***massive data volumes*** and ***personalized viewing experiences***.  
* ***Zoom***: Enables over ***300 million daily meeting participants*** to connect via cloud infrastructure providing bandwidth and global reach.

## **Challenges & Considerations**

* ***Data Security and Privacy***: Concerns about ***data breaches*** and ***compliance*** with privacy regulations.  
* ***Vendor Lock-in Risks***: Migrating data/apps can be ***complex and costly*** due to proprietary services.  
* ***Potential Data Loss and Downtime***: Outages or cyberattacks can lead to temporary ***data inaccessibility***.  
* ***Need for Skilled Cloud Engineers***: Designing and maintaining systems requires ***specialized expertise***.

## **Data Stream**

***What is Data Stream***: A ***data stream*** is an existing, ***continuous, ordered*** (implicitly by entrance time or explicitly by timestamp) ***chain of items***. It is unfeasible to control the order in which units arrive or to locally capture the stream in its ***entirety***.

### **Characteristics of Data Stream**

1. Large volumes of ***continuous data***, possibly infinite.  
2. ***Steady changing*** and requires a ***fast, real-time response***.  
3. ***Random access is expensive*** and requires a ***single scan algorithm***.  
4. Store only the ***summary of the data*** seen so far.

### **Types of Data Stream**

* ***Transactional data stream***: Credit card purchases; ***Telecommunications*** (phone calls); ***Web*** (accesses by clients).

### **Advantages and Disadvantages of Data Streams**

***Advantages***: Helpful in ***upgrading sales***, recognizing the ***fallacy***, ***minimizing costs***, and reacting swiftly to ***risk***.

***Disadvantages***: ***Lack of security*** in the cloud, ***vendor subordination***, and potential for ***disconnection***.
