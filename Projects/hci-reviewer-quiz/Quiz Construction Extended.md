# **HCI Quiz Question Ideas**

This document outlines specific question types tailored to the HCI reviewer content, focusing on concepts, relationships, and attributions.

### **1\. For Section 1.2 ("Components of ID")**

This section is about categorization. The goal is to test if the user knows which concepts belong to which group.

**Question Type: "Categorization Sorter"**

* **How it works:** Create "buckets" for each category and a list of shuffled terms. The user must drag the terms into the correct bucket.  
* **Example:**  
  * **Question:** "Drag each of the following terms into the correct category it belongs to in Interaction Design."  
  * **Buckets:**  
    * Academic Disciplines  
    * Design Practices  
    * Interdisciplinary Fields  
  * **Shuffled Terms:**  
    * Graphic Design  
    * HCI  
    * Ergonomics  
    * CSCW  
    * Psychology  
    * Product Design

### **2\. For Section 1.3 ("Who is Involved?")**

This section is about the pros (Benefits) and cons (Downsides) of a concept.

**Question Type: "Benefit / Downside Identification"**

* **How it works:** Present a statement from the reviewer and ask the user to classify it as a "Benefit" or a "Downside" of using multidisciplinary teams.  
* **Example:**  
  * **Question:** "Is the following statement a BENEFIT or a DOWNSIDE of multidisciplinary teams?"  
  * **Statement 1:** "Leads to more ideas being generated and more creative, original designs."  
    * \[ \] Benefit  
    * \[ \] Downside  
  * **Statement 2:** "Can be costly and lead to communication difficulties due to different terminology."  
    * \[ \] Benefit  
    * \[ \] Downside

### **3\. For Sections 1.4, 2.4 ("Who said what")**

This content is perfect for matching attributions (people/dates) to their concepts.

**Question Type: "Attribution Matching"**

* **How it works:** Create two columns. Column A has the person/date, and Column B has their key quote or concept. The user must match them.  
* **Example:**  
  * **Question:** "Match the expert to their key concept or quote."  
  * **Column A (People):**  
    1. Don Norman (1988)  
    2. Jakob Nielsen & Don Norman (2014)  
    3. Jesse Garrett  
    4. Don Norman (2004)  
  * **Column B (Concepts):**  
    * (A) Defined UX as "all aspects of the end user's interaction..."  
    * (B) Used car controls to explain the "Visibility" principle.  
    * (C) Said we must "build joy and excitement, pleasure and fun" into products.  
    * (D) Stated that "Even a ketchup bottle has a user experience."

### **4\. For Sections 2.2 & 2.4 (Usability Goals & Design Principles)**

These sections are lists of terms and their definitions, ideal for matching.

**Question Type: "Definition Matching"**

* **How it works:** Similar to attribution matching, but for terms and their definitions.  
* **Example:**  
  * **Question:** "Match the Design Principle to its correct definition."  
  * **Column A (Principles):**  
    1. Visibility  
    2. Feedback  
    3. Constraint  
    4. Consistency  
    5. Affordance  
  * **Column B (Definitions):**  
    * (A) "Sending back information about what action has been done..."  
    * (B) "An attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it..."  
    * (C) "The more visible functions are, the more likely users will know what to do..."  
    * (D) "Restricting the kinds of user interaction that can take place..."  
    * (E) "Designing interfaces to have similar operations for similar tasks..."

### **5\. For Section 2.3 (UX Goals \- Desirable/Undesirable)**

This is a simple classification task.

**Question Type: "Two-Column Sorter" (or "Classification")**

* **How it works:** Provide a term from the list and ask the user to classify it as 'Desirable' or 'Undesirable'.  
* **Example:**  
  * **Question:** "Classify the following UX Goal as 'Desirable' or 'Undesirable'."  
  * **Term:** "Engaging"  
    * \[ \] Desirable  
    * \[ \] Undesirable  
  * **Term:** "Boring"  
    * \[ \] Desirable  
    * \[ \] Undesirable
